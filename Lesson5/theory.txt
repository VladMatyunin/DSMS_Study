   POSTGRES ISOLATION LEVELS

Begin Transaction Isolation level level_name option;

level_name =[Serializable....], Default Read committed

option=[Read Write|Read Only]

Begin Transaction Isolation Level Serializable read only;
....
Commit;

*If ddl query=>all queries are committed automatically


SAVEPOINT option
Begin;
Update .....
Savepoint my_savepoint;
Update ....
Rollback to my_savepoint;
Update......
Commit;


AUTONOMOUS Transaction (Oracle only)

Pragma AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION
Begin
....

Made to cope with exceptions, when transaction rolls back.
Helps to create logs (because the whole transaction will be canceled)

Shingling
*Document is string of characters
*Define k-shingle is any substring of length k
*Document associates with set of k-shingles

D='abcdabd', if k=2 then

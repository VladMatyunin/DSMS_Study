Execute immediate "Create table test(...);"
-immediate means to execute statement without any retrieve result set

v$sql - stores all queries (Oracle)

Type of tables
-Heap table
-index-organized table (placed separately-best practice)
-partitioning table
-temporary table

Temporary tables
Physical tables, but values after session end are deleted

Create temporary table [If not exists] temp_location
{
...
}
 On commit delete rows;
 [On commit preserve rows - default,
  on commit drop]

Used in preprocessing

In Oracle
Create Global Temporary Table ...
On Commit Delete Rows; -- TTL during transaction
On commit preserve rows; -- TTL during session

Truncate table vs delete
delete does not reorganize file
truncate works faster
but from delete we can undo changes and restore deleted files


==================================
Index organized table
Index B-tree table stores the whole data
Works much faster + optimal disk usage

Oracle:
Create table (..
..)
Organization index tablespace ... including X ;
if X exists, then X will be stored inside B-tree Node with PK

Postgres: Not exists, but have similar one:

CLUSTER [VERBOSE] table_name [USING index_name];
Table will be ordered after this command, but during search b-tree and table are separated


===================================
Partitioning Table

Oracle:
3+2 types:
-List partitioning - sort people by gender
-Range partitioning - sort dates (months)
-Hash partitioning - for good spread of data

Composite:
-Range+Hash
-Range+List

Create Table(
...,
Partition by range(sales_date))
(
Partition ... Values less than (...)
Partition ... Values less than (...)
)

Create Table(
...,
Partition by list(sales_date))
(
Partition ... Values(...)
Partition ... Values(...)
)

Create Table(
...,
Partition by hash(sales_date))

Partitions 4
Store in (..,..,..);

create table users_1() inherits(users);
create table users_1(like users including all) inherits(users);
